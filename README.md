# dl-projects

This repository contains some of my DL projects:
1. `pytorch-analogue` contains:
    1. Different layers (Linear, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Sequential)
    2. Activations (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax, LogSoftmax)
    3. Criterions (MSELoss, CrossEntropyLoss)
    4. Dataloader 
It can be used for training neural network, all layers and activations support backpropagation.
